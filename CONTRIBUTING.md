Please send PR only to the `master` branch.

### Coding Style

This projects follows [Google's Java Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html) loosely.

If you can try to use lombok as much as possible. If you want to add JavaDoc to generated getters and setters have read
[here](https://projectlombok.org/features/GetterSetter.html).

For static/final inner lombok `@Data` classes please follow this convention:

```java
final @Data class Foo {}
```


### git branching model

This project used to be developed in the develop branch and this branch was merged into the master branch for each release.
A typical [git flow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) one might say.

Recently I have read [this article](http://endoflineblog.com/gitflow-considered-harmful) which shows why git flow isn't the best
solution; and I have to say that I agree with the author.

The master branch does __NOT provide any value__ to the history. Every release is tagged and checking out the latest stable
release is now for example `git checkout 0.4` instead of `git checkout master`. For this even more clear and verbose than
the git flow approach, isn't it.

Beside dropping the develop branch this project follows git flow to some degree. Feature branches are still a thing and
might be on remote as well. Please do not consider these as official "achtern" branches. They are subject to frequent changes
and might be gone just days after release.

If you want to send pull request please __DO NOT__ rebase your feature branch, I'd like to keep the development process
in the projects history (if you want to merge hundreds of tiny commits this policy might not apply though...).

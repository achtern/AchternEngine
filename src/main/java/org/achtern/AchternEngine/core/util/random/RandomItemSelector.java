     * This method accepts a map of items and a float value.
     *  This float value represents a probability.
     *
     * This is very similar to {@link #getRandom(java.util.List)}, but now
     *  you can define a probability for each item. This float value should be
     *  in the interval of [0,1], where 0 is 0% and 1 is 100%
     *
     * The resolution parameter defines how fine the percentage can be.
     *
     * For example: with a resolution of 100, the lowest percentage can be 1% and
     *  with 100 0.1% and so forth.
     *
     * NOTE: This method works by creating a List of the size of the resolution. Therefor
     *  large resolutions will create large lists on the heap!
